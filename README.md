#### Project Description:

The project shows how to fetch data from a 3rd party API and show it on the UI in a tabular format using React components. 

#### Version: 1.0.0

#### Motivation: 

I want to learn react so I started with a project that fetches data and updates on the UI. I was told that, software engineers normally fetch and update data on the UI.
Hence I started with this example.

###### Topics/ Concepts: 

I had learnt and practised the following concepts in React while working on this project. 

   * React Class
   * React State and updating the state using setState
   * React Components
   * React Hooks ( useState )
   * React Lifecycle
   * Axios Library Vs node-fetch Vs request
   * React List and Keys
   * How to  update the react component,  when we receive Array or Object
   * How to create a table using the default <table> 
   * How to create table using external library like [React-Table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/docs/api)
